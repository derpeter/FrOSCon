This is an Android WebApp to display the mobile website created by a [Python
Script](https://github.com/derpeter/Conference-Mobile-Schedule)  which is
intended to be used  with the XML output of

[Pentabarf](http://www.pentabarf.org) or
[frab](https://github.com/frab/frab).

The version in this repository will be used for the
[FrOSCon](http://froscon.org) so you need  to modify some FrOSCon related
links.

To build this app you need also [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/) which is used to make the app android 2.x compatible.

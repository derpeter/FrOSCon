This is an Android WebViewApp to display the mobile website created by a [Python
Script](https://github.com/derpeter/Conference-Mobile-Schedule) which is
intended to be used with the XML output of [Pentabarf](https://www.pentabarf.org) or [frab](https://github.com/frab/frab).

The version in this repository will be used for the
[FrOSCon](https://froscon.org) so you need  to modify some FrOSCon related
links / strings / images.

To build this app you need also [ActionBarSherlock](https://actionbarsherlock.com/) which is used to make the app android 2.x compatible.
